    <p>Cog log helps doctors and caretakers administer the Mini-Mental State Exam and keep track of its scores.
    </p>

    <p>The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) has been the most widely used cognitive test for dementia in US clinical practice,
    although patent protection has led to increased use of other bedside exams. The MMSE takes approximately seven minutes to complete. It tests a broad range of cognitive functions including orientation,
    recall, attention, calculation, language manipulation, and constructional praxis.
    </p>

    <p>The maximum score on the MMSE is 30 points. A score of less than 24 points is suggestive of dementia or delirium.
    However, the test is not sensitive for mild dementia, and scores may be influenced by age and education, as well as language, motor, and visual impairments.
    The pattern of missed questions can be as important as the overall score; if the clinical deficit is memory loss, a person may miss all three objects on delayed recall and score 27,
    which for that individual would be a false-negative result if a cutoff of 24 is being used.
