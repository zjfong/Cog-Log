      <p>The Mini-Mental State Exam is a useful screening test for dementia; a score of less than 24 points is suggestive of dementia or delirium.
      </p>
      <p>Using a cutoff of 24 points, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 87 percent and a specificity of 82 percent in a large hospital-based sample. However, the test is not sensitive for mild dementia,
      and scores may be influenced by age and education, as well as language, motor, and visual impairments.
      </p>
      <p>The MMSE has limitations for assessing progressive cognitive decline in individual patients over time. Changes of two points or less are of uncertain clinical significance as they may represent measurement error,
      regression to the mean, or a practice effect</p>
      <p>The MMSE also has utility in assessing decision-making capacity but is not a substitute for an assessment of capacity. While low scores (eg, <16 out of 30 points)
      in patients with dementia due to Alzheimer disease are highly correlated with impaired capacity, higher scores may or may not correlate with full capacity to make decisions.
